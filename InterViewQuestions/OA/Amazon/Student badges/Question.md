**Similar leetcode question**: [1567. Maximum Length of Subarray With Positive Product](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-subarray-with-positive-product/)  

A question about Amazon student badges but ultimately the problem was given an arr of -1 or 1, return the maximum subarray length with a product of 1.  
The array is of size 2 and above and only contains -1 and 1  
e.g arr = [-1,-1,1,1,-1], return 4, since index 0 to 3 have the max length with product equal to 1
