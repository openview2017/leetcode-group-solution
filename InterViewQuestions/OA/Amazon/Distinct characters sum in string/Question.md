**reference link**: (https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1482521/amazon-oa-sde2) Question 1

Given a string, return the sum of count of distinct characters in all the substrings of that string.  
For example:  
Input String - "test"  
Possible substrings with distinct character count  
"t" -> 1  
"e" -> 1  
"s" -> 1  
"t" -> 1  
"te" -> 2  
"es" -> 2  
"st" -> 2  
"tes" -> 3  
"est" -> 3  
"test" -> 3  
Number of distinct chars - 1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+3 = 19  
Output - 19
